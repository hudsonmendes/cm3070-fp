# Package `hlm12erc`

Hi, my name is Hudson Leonardo MENDES!

This python package contains all the software produced for my<br />
CM3070 Final Computer Science Project by the Unviersity of London<br />
for my BSc Computer Science specialised in Machine Learning & Data Science.

This `README.md` should contain everything that is required to<br />
run not just my Algorithm/Model for Emotion Recognition in Conversations<br />
but also all other utility code that I have used to work on the project,<br />
including, but not limited to:

- ETL (transforming the raw MELD data into 1NF)
- ERC Model Training
- ERC Inference itself

```
